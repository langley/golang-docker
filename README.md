# README.md

This git originally came from [github](https://github.com/afdolriski/golang-docker)
But I cloned it so I could add this file and play with it more easily

There is [an excellent article that goes with it](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/complete-guide-to-create-docker-container-for-your-golang-application-80f3fb59a15e)
